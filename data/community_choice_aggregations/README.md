# Data Overview

There is currently no definitive source of geospatial data for the coverage areas of the various Community Choice Aggregations which are active throughout the state of California. Consequently, we have endeavored  to create such a dataset here using a combination of publicly available data the Cal-CCA trade organization as well as individual CCA's themselves. These data sets are assembled from underlying city, county, and unincorporated area reference geometries previously obtained from the Census as part of the overall workflow.

# Data Description

This workflow constructs four tables. The first three have been manually assembled from published information about the geographic service territories of the state's various CCA's. There is one each for cities/places, counties, and county unincorporated areas. An individual CCA can be comprised of one or more of each of these three different geography classes. These first three layers do not have geospatial information and are used to perform the joins necessary to extract geospatial attributes from the relevant census geography tables.

Once the lists of which CCA's are associated with which various geographies have been imported as tables, the various geographies are selected and merged into one final output table with a geospatial attribute field.

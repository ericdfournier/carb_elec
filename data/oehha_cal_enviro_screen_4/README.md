Variable Name
Description
   Census Tract
   Total Population
   California County
   ZIP
      Approximate Location
Approximate city, town, or area where each census tract is located based on US Census Incorporated Places (2020, Cities), US Census Designated Places, (2020, Designated Places), and the CA Department of Tax and Fees City and County Boundaries and City Annexations (2021, Unincorporated Areas) boundary files. All tracts that did not fall within one of these boundaries were assigned "unincorporated county area" based on that tract's county. This is for reference purposes only and should not be used to determine whether a census tract falls within a city or town boundary.

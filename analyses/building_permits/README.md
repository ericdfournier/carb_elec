# Building Permit Sample Analysis

This directory contains a python script which was used to generate figures and analytics for the final building permit data sample. These were presented on at the project's July 2023 Quarterly progress update meeting.

Notes:

- [building_permits_analysis.py](/analyses/building_permits/building_permits_analysis.py) requires a connection to a locally hosted postgres database containing the relevant building permit data tables documented in [/data/building_permits](/data/building_permits/)

- [/analyses/building_permits/fig](/analyses/building_permits/fig/) contains the raw figure outputs generated by this script.

- [/analyses/building_permits/fig/maps/](/analyses/building_permits/fig/maps/) also contains a number of maps which were manually developed using these same data using the external qGIS application.
